To encourage greater involvement in climate action, the Climate Friendly Households Programme (CFHP) will be further enhanced through the provision of an additional $100 worth of Climate Vouchers for eligible HDB households, on top of the existing $300. The programme will also be expanded to include Singapore Citizen households registered and living in private residential properties. Eligible households may claim their Climate Vouchers from 15 April 2025 to 31 December 2027.
